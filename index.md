<div style="text-align: justify"> We want to predict house sale prices in Ames,IA using 80 housing features and to identify features that have the most influence on house sale price. The best model could be used by realtors and buyers to estimate price for a house with specific features that they want to sell/buy.
<br>
We applied 11 regression algorithms from linear to non-linear techniques, from parametric to non-parametric techniques. We conclude that the best model is the Gradient Boosting model with a test MSE of 0.0173, equal to test MAPE of 14.5%. Four most important predictors are Overall material and finish quality, Above grade (ground) living area square feet, Total square feet of basement area, and Original construction date.
<br>
Models: Best subset selection, LASSO, Ridge Regression, PCR, PLS, KNN, Regression Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting
