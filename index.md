<div style="text-align: justify"> I want to predict the price of a car using 11 characteristics of the car and identify the characteristics that have the most influence on the price of the car. The best model can be used by auto dealers and buyers to estimate the price for a car with specific characteristics they want to sell/buy.
<br> <br>
I have built a Linear Regression Model with 2 forms: Simple and Multiple <br> <br>
With the Simple Linear Regression Model, we choose the feature that has the most influence on the car sales price through the correlation coefficient represented through the Heatmap chart. In conclusion, I chose the variable that has the most influence as Power_perf_factor and the R_squared coefficient is 80.28% <br> <br>
With Multiple Linear Regression Model, we select the variables into the model through the p-value and test the variables for fit by the VIF coefficient. In conclusion, we can choose 2 variables to be included in the model, Power_perf_factor and Enginesize with adjusted R_squared coefficient of 83.68%.

Model: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression
